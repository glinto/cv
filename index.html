				<h1>Summary</h1>
				<div>
					<p>I always considered myself a generalist who loves creating software.</p>
					<p>
						Over the years I assumed multiple roles, from developer to director. I learnt how to build out a startup
						team to a mid size company from scratch to an exit, which is probably the thing I am most proud of.
					</p>
					<p>
						But most of all, I am so thankful that I live in exceptional times and have a chance to work with
						exceptional people.

						<p>
							In this hands-on advsiory role, I work with a new team and I help set up the software development
							lifecycle, team, and build the technical stack (full stack, front-end focus with Vue/Typescript). We
							create virtual training environments for cyber security trainings.

						<h3>Vizzu</h3>
						<h3>Assist in creating a team and an MVP</h3>
						<p>
							Since 2022 I have been an advisor for Vizzu, a startup with an innovative data visualization company.

							building the team, setting up the development process, and build the technical stack (front-end focus with
							Vue/TS).

						<h3>Linear Labs Inc</h3>
						<h3>Hands-on manager, build a team and a smart motor solution from scratch in the IoT space</h3>
						<p>
							Reuniting with our ex-cofounder, at Linear Labs we started again from scratch! We built connected electric
							motors, where my team was responsible for motor controls, IoT connectivity, and a Cloud/application stack.
							Besides team management I was hands-on with our data ingest platform (Typescript/Node/Kafka), Mobile PWA
							(Vue/Typescript), AWS setup and our cloud CICD pipelines.

						<h2>Head of Operations</h2>
						<h3>IBM Budapest Lab</h3>
						<h3>Post-acqusition integration of an engineering org (150 people)</h3>
						<p>
							My job was integrating ourselves, a freshly acquired engineering organization, into IBM. My priority was
							to preserve Ustream’s agile and high performing values and culture. This period was also good to catch up
							with technologies such as the NodeJS, Typescript, Mongo, Docker, and AWS, for which I previously did not
							have time during the super busy acquisition era.

						<h2>VP, R&D</h2>
						<h3>Ustream Inc</h3>
						<h3>Stabilization and exit (acquisition)</h3>
						<p>
							My role gradually shifted towards being a COO for Ustream Hungary. My focus was the overall performance
							and success of the engineering organization from project delivery, through client success to financial
							aspects. My technical contribution was architecting, and coding auxiliary tools for monitoring and
							tracking. In the final pre-acquisition year, I worked almost exclusively on closing the IBM deal from
							early discussions through due diligence to signing.

						<h2>Director, Development</h2>
						<h3>Ustream Inc</h3>
						<h3>Mature a SaaS product and grow an engineering team from 30 to 150</h3>
						<p>
							I was promoted to lead the entire development operation. After our Series B funding, we were a growing
							company with their funny problems like getting a bit more organized or going in one direction. We were
							embracing Agile methodologies, and I was committed to lead that effort while still leading some of the
							SCRUM teams. In this period, my focus shifted more towards leadership, team building and our SDLC.

						<h2>Project Manager</h2>
						<h3>Ustream Inc</h3>
						<h3>Early startup (team of 10-30) and product launches</h3>
						<p>
							Joined the very early Ustream team as a PjM and helped the team implement project management basics.
							Later, as Ustream grew, I built out our PjM team. It was my obsessed-with-tracking era, I introduced JIRA
							and familiarized the company with using it in a sensible way. Developed early reporting and executive
							summaries for founders.

							e-commerce stores in the country.

						<h2>Self-employed</h2>
						<h3>Learning to run a business</h3>
						<p>
							I have built a small team where we created web-based software for our own clients (mostly in PHP, .NET
							with MySQL and MSSQL databases). This also was my introduction to the project management domain, as I was
							coordinating multiple devs at client projects. My biggest takeaway was learning all aspects of running an
							own business and to develop my PjM/generic management skills.
