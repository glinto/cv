            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I always considered myself a generalist who loves creating software. Been coding since the 8-bit
                    era, later typically in fullstack (LAMP and .NET then moved over to Node/TypeScript). Like
                    everyone else, had to adopt higher level concepts, patterns, versioning, cloud computing,
                    containerization and DevOps to be successful with code at scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years I assumed more manager/director/VP roles. I learnt the hard way what leadership was
                    about and
                    how to build out a startup team to a mid size company from scratch to exit, which is probably the
                    thing I am
                    most proud of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But most of all, I am so thankful that I live in exceptional times and had a chance to work with
                    exceptional
                    people.

                        Reuniting with our ex-cofounder, at Linear Labs we start again from scratch! We build connected
                        electric motors, where my team is responsible for motor controls, IoT connectivity, and a
                        Cloud/application stack. We work on smart solutions, such as live telemetry and diagnostics,
                        battery and range optimization and tailoring vehicle control based on user habits and
                        preferences. Once again, I am super lucky to work with extremely talented people. This involves
                        a dive into embedded space, too, which is an exciting challenge and a steep learning curve.

                    <p>
                        My role was integrating the Ustream engineering organization into IBM. My priority was to
                        preserve Ustream’s agile and high performing values and culture. It was a steep learning curve
                        and taxing situation for all of us; invested a lot of time in how IBM works and
                        how to use and navigate the system with our team. IBM is all about connections, had to invest in
                        diplomacy and
                        working relationships with various business functions on which an
                        R&D software lab would depend. This period was also good to catch up with technologies such as
                        the MEVN stack, TS, Docker, and AWS, for which I previously did not have time during the super
                        busy acquisition era.

                    <h3>Stabilization and exit (acquisition)</h3>
                    <p>
                        From 2014, with our leadership group, product and processes being stronger, my role gradually
                        shifted towards being a COO for Ustream Hungary. I mostly took over running everyday business
                        from our founder. I was spending more time with budget and expenses than ever before, addressed
                        our work/legal challenges, worked on our employer branding, worked closely with finance, HR and
                        customer success. My focus was the overall performance and success of the engineering
                        organization from project delivery, through client success to financial aspects. In the final
                        pre-acquisition year, I worked almost exclusively on closing the IBM deal from early discussions
                        through due diligence to signing.

                        I was promoted to lead the entire development operation. After our Series B funding, we were a
                        growing company with their funny problems like getting a bit more organized or going in one
                        direction. We were embracing Agile methodologies, and I was committed to lead that effort while
                        still leading some of the SCRUM teams. Produced a complete internal handbook on Product
                        Development and SCRUM rules and roles; both tailored to our needs. We created our own bucketing
                        system to allow stakeholders (sales, customer success, marketing) to work with developers, but
                        still protecting developers time to focus on our product and technical roadmap. We also worked
                        on our service excellence with an on-call engineering duty around the clock and reached 99%
                        customer satisfaction. Started to learn and share leadership skills, did training sessions and
                        handbooks to emerging leaders.

                        Joined the very early Ustream team as a PjM and helped the team implement project management
                        basics. Later, as Ustream grew, I built out our PjM team. It was my obsessed-with-tracking era,
                        I introduced JIRA and familiarized the company with using it in a sensible way. Developed early
                        reporting and executive summaries for founders.

                        At BIG FISH our main proficiency was delivering SMB web store solutions and integrating them

                        projects for major e-commerce stores in the country. We were a high performing team with a great
                        culture where I could develop my coding/PjM skills further and learn how to work with large
                        clients and projects.

                        I have built a small team where we created web-based software for our own clients (mostly

                        multiple devs at client projects. My biggest takeaway was learning all aspects of running an own
                        business and to develop my PjM/generic management skills.
